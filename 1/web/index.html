    <h1>Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photos</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this project was to use photos from each of the RGB channels and align them to make a proper color photo.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <p>
        The crux of my code was centered around my align function, which basically treats the photo with the blue filter as the anchor
        and tries to individually align the green and red filter photos with the anchor. I started with a displacement of [-30, -30] and
        moved all the way to [30, 30], and during each displacement, or iteration, I used a function called structural_similarity from the
        skimage.metrics library to calculate a metric that measures how similar the anchor is to the image being shifted. How the package actually
        works was beyond the scope of our understanding at the time when the project was assigned, but it was approved by the course staff.

        For the smaller jpg images, calling this align function one time for both the green and red filter photos was enough to have it align, 
        but for the bigger tif images, we had to implement something called a gaussian pyramid, which basically takes an image and repeatedly makes
        it more coarse till it reaches a small enough size that I could then call this align function on and have it run optimally. I reduced the image
        four times, each time making it half the size, so when my align function returned the optimal shift at the coarsest level, I just kept multiplying
        that shift by 2 for four iterations. I think used this final shift to align the big images and get my color photo.

        Even after implementing this pyramid, there were some images like melons.tif and self_portrait.tif that wouldn't align accurately, so I ended up
        cropping the image at the coarsest level by 15% on each of its sides to eradicate any non-overlapping pixels and then I built the image back up, 
        at which point I aligned it. This seemed to work on all the images and I didn't have any problems at the end.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Images</h2>

    <p>
        The following images are from the artist's collection, and this is how they look once aligned. As you can see, there are weird bars around
        the edges for most of them, showing that there needed to be some displacement/alignment in order to reconstruct the image properly. For each
        image, there are two shifts noted, one for the green-filter image and one for the red-filter image. The units are pixels, so the shifts tell
        you how many pixels those specific images had to be moved by.
