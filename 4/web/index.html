            <h2>Part 1: Shooting the Pictures</h2>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>I chose three sets of pictures, the first set being of my living room, the second set 
                    being of some tapestries in my room, and third set being of my desk.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While taking the photos, there were a couple of things to keep in mind, the main one being 
                    to keep the center of projection (COP) the same. This meant that when I was taking the second photo, 
                    the only thing I could do was move the phone to the right or left; I couldn't change the angle at which I 
                    was taking the photo. I'm well aware that image processing techniques exist where you can stitch two photos
                    that are taken at different angles, but that was out of the scope of this project ;)

            <h2>Part 2: Recover the Homographies</h2>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>
                    For each pair of images, I used the online tool provided by the course staff to pick out correspondence points
                    pertainining to relevant features. Once I got the list of these points, I iterated through
                    each pair of correspondences and formulated a linear equation relating the two points. The goal was to come
                    up with a set of coefficients, known as the Homography matrix, that would provide a mapping between the points in 
                    the first image and those in the second. Since there are 8 coefficients we have to solve for (the 9th is assumed to be 1.0),
                    we would need 8 equations to solve it normally, but since we have way more than 8 equations, the system 
                    becomes overdetermined, leading us to use least squares to find the best possible set of coefficients.

            <h2>Part 3: Warp the Images</h2>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>
                    This is where the mosaic process starts to take off. Now that I have the homography matrix 
                    that I computed in the previous part, I can map the entirety of the first image to the second image's 
                    space. I start by warping the corners of the image so that I can get an idea of the "bounding box" formed 
                    by the warped image. Then I iterate through all the points within this range, use the inverse of the 
                    homography matrix to get the pixel value in the original image, and if that point exists within the 
                    original image's range, I then set the pixel value of the new point to the pixel value I just retrieved. 
                    If the point doesn't exist, it remains black, which is why in the images below, you see some parts of the 
                    image are just dark.

            <h2>Part 5: Blending Images into a Mosaic</h2>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>
                    This was probably the heftiest part of the project. I started off by setting up a canvas large enough 
                    to accommodate both images side by side. I also calculated the necessary positions to place each 
                    image on the canvas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To handle the blending, I generated distance transforms to create masks for each image, which 
                    helped identify the transition zones between them. These masks were normalized and used to blend 
                    the overlapping parts of the images smoothly. I then applied two-band blending by 
                    separating each image into low and high-frequency components. To generate the former, I simply defined
                    a 2-D gaussian kernel with size 15 x 15 and standard deviation 4, and convolved the image with it. To get 
                    the latter, I took this lower-resolution image, subtracted it from the original image, and then multiplied it
                    by a binary mask to get rid of any noise. The low-frequency components were blended using weighted averages based 
                    on the values at a specific coordinate in the distance transform arrays, while the high-frequency components were 
                    blended based on which image had a stronger presence at each pixel, meaning that if image A had a higher presence,
                    I would take the value at the high-pass version of image A.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, I combined the low and high-frequency blended components to produce the final 
                    composite image, maintaining both smooth transitions and sharp details across the seam.

            <h2>Step 1: Harris Interest Point Detector</h2>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>We start off the process by detecting prominent features in each of
                    the images, namely corners. The Harris Detector takes care of this
                    by looking at how the image gradients change in different directions
                    for each pixel, and evaluating it as a corner if it sees that there 
                    is a great change in pixel intensity in multiple corners. As you can
                    see on the following initial images, the detector detects a boatload of
                    points on each, not guaranteeing a one-to-one correspondence between the 
                    images as the process is undergone separately on both images. We will 
                    see in later steps how you take care of this concern

            <h2>Step 2: Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression</h2>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression, or ANMS for short, is an algorithm
                    designed to remove "redundant" information returned by Harris Detector, 
                    meaning that it attempts remove clusters of points and spread out all the
                    significant points. To do this, I basically took the list of coordinates
                    returned by the Harris Detector, and I tracked the minimum distance for each
                    to another coordinate that had a higher corner strength score. I then took 
                    the list of all these distances, sorted them by farthest distance to closest
                    distance, and then took the top 100 of these points. This way, I get 100 points
                    that are spread out on the image. As you see on the following two images, the points
                    are now much more spread out and less cluttered.

            <h2>Step 3: Feature Descriptor Extraction & Feature Matching</h2>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>Onto the third step, where we want to attribute a unique identifier to each 
                    point such that we can use it to match points from one image to another later on.
                    Up till this point, the set of selected features on either image have no relation
                    to each other as both Steps 1 & 2 were conducted separately on the image, so extracting
                    the features is the first step towards matching them. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To get the feature descriptors, I took the points returned by the ANMS algorithm, and for each
                    one, I extracted a 40x40 pixel patch from the image surrounding that point. Then I scaled it down
                    to an 8x8 patch using sk.transform.rescale, with a scale factor of 0.2, and proceeded to 
                    normalize this patch by subtracting it's mean from it and dividing the result by the standard deviation. 
                    I then flattened this patch into a 1-D array and eventually created a matrix of size (100, 64), where each
                    row was one point and each column represented a pixel value from the 8x8 unique patch.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once I got the descriptor matrix for both images, I used the dist2 function provided 
                    by the course staff to get my hands on a distance matrix of size (100, 100), where the i,jth 
                    entry of the resultant matrix was the Euclidean distance between the ith descriptor vector of 
                    image 1 and the jth descriptor vector of image 2. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then what I did was I looped through each descriptor vector in image 1 and found two things: 
                    the descriptor vector of image 2 that it was closest too and second closest too. I then applied
                    the concept of Lowe's ratio to check if the ratio of the former to the latter was below 0.8, and if 
                    so, I would go ahead and append the coordinate in image 1 and it's nearest neighbor as a feature match.
                    Lowe's ratio is employed to eliminate matches where the closest and second-closest matches 
                    are almost equally similar.

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>Now that we have our correspondences, the point of RANSAC is to compute the best homography 
                    by picking samples of points, using them to compute H, and then applying that H to each point in
                    image A's correspondences to get the projected points in image B's space. If the projected point was within 
                    a distance of whatever's defined by the value inlier_threshold, which in my case was 400 pixels since my images were big, 
                    then I would add it to my set of final correspondences. I did this proceess 500 times before I got my final list of
                    correspondences. The first two images show the final correspondences on each image and the third one shows 
                    the projected points from image 1 besides their matched pairs in image 2. For the most part, they are pretty accurate.
                    The final homography matrix I use for creating the mosaic is the one that returns the most inlier points.

                <p>
                    Now that I had the correspondence points for each image, where there was a one to one mapping between images, 
                    I utilitzed the functions I implemented in part A to warp the first image to the homography of the second, and then
